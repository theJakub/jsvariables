<!-- Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of healthy weight.
It can be calculated by taking your weight in kilograms and dividing by the square of your height in meters. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a weight in pounds and a height in feet and inches and displays the user's BMI value. To convert the users weight in pounds to their weight in kilograms you will need to use the fact that there are 2.2 pounds in one kilogram. -->

<body>
	<div>Your BMI is-</div>
	<div id="output"></div>
	<script>
		var w = prompt("What is your weight in pounds?");
		var h = prompt("What is your height in feet? Put inches in next prompt.");
		var i = parseFloat(prompt("What is your height remainder in inches?"));

		var kg = (w/2.2);
		var m = (((h*12)+ i) *0.0254);

		var bmi = (kg / (m*m));

		document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = bmi;

		console.log(kg);
		console.log(m);
